# John_Smith_Photography

This is a portfolio of an imaginary photographer John Smith. For this project I'm using Sass, vanilla JavaScript (trying to implement as much ES6 syntax as I can) and that's about it. Regarding layout, I'm relying on flexbox and CSS grid on a few sections. I'm also trying to make it as much responsive as possible.
